# scalable-multiclass-classification-lightgbm-catboost
This project aims to solve a multi-class classification problem using a dataset of 1.2 million samples. The dataset was preprocessed, balanced, and used to train and evaluate two advanced machine learning models: LightGBM and CatBoost. The models were optimized and deployed using the ONNX runtime for efficient inference.
